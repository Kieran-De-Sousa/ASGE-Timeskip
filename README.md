Timeskip is a cooperative run-and-gun, 32-bit pixel platformer created in the OpenGL framework, [ASGE](https://github.com/HuxyUK/ASGE). Created by a team of five in our ‘More Games In C++’ module, the project utilises modern C++ practices to ensure a highly efficient and reusable code base. The game features controller support, multiple levels, and AI. 

The code base adopts Object-Oriented Programming approaches alongside a focus on “composition over inheritance”. Classes are de-coupled and make use of component class interfaces to ensure high code maintainability. This large game project furthered our proficiency using version control systems and methods of ensuring high runtime performance.
